## Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood
#### *A Robot that turns certain numbers into beeps, boops, and a Mr. Rogers phrase*
***By Andrew Lawson Â© 2021***

## *Description:*
This webpage will take a number submitted by the user, and display an array leading up to the number inputted, with "beep", "boop", and "Won't You Be My Neighbor?" taking the place of numbers that consist of "1", "2", and "3". The JavaScript logic incorporates variables, for loops, if else statements, and array methods.

#### Test 5:
